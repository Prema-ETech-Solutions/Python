"""
Python Classes/Objects
Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, 
with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, 
or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
"""
# To create a class, use the keyword class:

class MyClass:
  x = 5

print(MyClass)
# Create Object
# Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
