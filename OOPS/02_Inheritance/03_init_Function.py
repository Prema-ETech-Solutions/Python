Add the __init__() Function
So far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and 
methods from its parent.

We want to add the __init__() function to the child class 
(instead of the pass keyword).  

When you add the __init__() function, 
the child class will no longer inherit the parent's __init__() function.

To keep the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function, 
add a call to the parent's __init__() function:
"""
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()
"""
Now we have successfully added the __init__() function, 
and kept the inheritance of the parent class, 
and we are ready to add functionality in the __init__() function.
