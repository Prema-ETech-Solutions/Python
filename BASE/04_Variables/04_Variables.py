Output Variables
The Python print statement is often used to output variables.

To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character: 
"""
x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)

# You can also use the + character to add a variable to another variable:

x = "Python is "
y = "awesome"
z =  x + y
print(z)
