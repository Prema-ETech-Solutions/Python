User Input
Python allows for user input.

That means we are able to ask the user for input.

The method is a bit different in Python 3.6 than 
Python 2.7.

Python 3.6 uses the input() method.

Python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method.

The following example asks for the username, 
and when you entered the username, 
it gets printed on the screen:


"""
print("Enter A Value_1")
val_1 =input()
print("Val_1 - "+val_1)

Val_2 = input("Enter A Value_2\n")
print("Val_2 - "+Val_2)
