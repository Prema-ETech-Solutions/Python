# Removing Items
# There are several methods to remove items from a dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)

"""
Example
The popitem() method removes the last inserted item 
(in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead): 
"""
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)


# The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)

# The clear() method empties the dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)
